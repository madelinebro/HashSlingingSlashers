# HashSlingingSlashers | Financial Management Application
This Full Stack Web Application is designed as a cross-platform solution, accessible from both mobile devices and web browsers, provided users have stable internet connection. Its primary purpose is to empower users to manage their finances with ease and clarity. Through the application, users can track budgets, categorize their spending into meaningful categories (e.g., transportations, groceries, shopping), and review account statements.

Our application allows users to transfer funds between accountsâ€”for example, moving
money from a checking account to a savings account with just a few clicks. A key feature of the
application is an integrated AI chatbot to provide users with quick, personalized feedback. Users
can ask a range of finance related questions, and the chatbot will aim to deliver clear, accurate
answers to support decision-making.

## Objectives

One key goal of the project is to ensure broad accessibility. This includes making the
application attainable across multiple operating systems and devices, ensuring that the text and
interface elements are consistently visible, readable, and user-friendly. Accessibility also
involves accommodating multilingual users by providing a multi-language interface so that users
from different regions can interact with the system comfortably and confidently. 

A second goal is security. The application must protect user data through a well-designed
security framework. This include performing regular security audits, enforcing secure password
policies with strong encryption, hashing stored passwords, and ensuring that all session
transmissions are protected against interception (e.g. session hijacking).

A third major goal is to leverage a cloud-based deployment environment. The objective is
to ensure that user data is backed up regularly and that the application remains available to users
anywhere, provide they have internet access. This idea supports scalability, in the sense that the
system can handle an increasing number of users and data overtime
